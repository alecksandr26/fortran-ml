This is just my personal compilation of notes. The purpose of this document is not professional;
it is simply a recompilation of my studies on artificial intelligence and its algorithms from scratch.

I have gathered information from various sources and documented my understanding, insights, and observations
on the subject matter. It serves as a reference and a way for me to solidify my knowledge.

Throughout this document, I aim to explore the fundamental concepts, theories, and techniques in the field
of artificial intelligence. From machine learning algorithms to neural networks, I delve into the intricacies
of these topics, providing explanations and examples along the way.

Please note that the information presented here is based on my personal interpretation and may not encompass
the entirety of the subject. Therefore, it is always recommended to refer to authoritative sources for a
comprehensive understanding of artificial intelligence.

I hope this document proves to be a valuable resource for those interested in learning about artificial
intelligence, as well as a testament to my own growth and development in this fascinating field.
