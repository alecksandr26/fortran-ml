# Machine Learning Code
It is just my machine learning code in fortran, for the moment I only have programmed a perceptron :).
# To compile
You need to install [assertf](https://github.com/alecksandr26/assert-fortran/blob/main/README.md) and after that run.
```
make
```
# Notes
These are my notes of each AI model, you only need to compile it.

# Examples
## Perceptrons examples
An example of the linear separability in some logic gates.

This is a graphical representation of the perceptrons weights, the perceptron try to classify rectangles and circles.
